Alice, Bob, and Carol visit a spring to collect water. Alice visits every `a` days (on days `a, 2a, 3a, …`), Bob visits every `b` days (on days `b, 2b, 3b, …`), and Carol visits every `c` days (on days `c, 2c, 3c, …`).

When only one person visits, they collect `6` liters of water. If multiple people visit, the water is divided equally: two people take `3` liters each, and three people take `2` liters each.

Your task is to calculate how much water Alice, Bob, and Carol collect over `m` days, starting from day `1`.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `m` (`1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^6`; `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^17`).

## Output

For each test case, print three integers — the number of liters of water that Alice, Bob, and Carol collect over `m` days.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2 1 3 10
1 1 8 5
6 20 15 1000
650650 1092 157437 100000000000000000
```

**Output:**

```
14 38 8 
15 15 0 
881 236 281 
845294870595 549337065358857 3774389867286 
```

## Note

Consider the first example:

 - on day `1`, only Bob visits the spring, and he collects `6` liters;
- on day `2`, Alice and Bob visit the spring, and they each collect `3` liters;
- on day `3`, Bob and Carol visit the spring, and they each collect `3` liters;
- on day `4`, Alice and Bob visit the spring, and they each collect `3` liters;
- on day `5`, only Bob visits the spring, and he collects `6` liters;
- on day `6`, Alice, Bob, and Carol visit the spring, and they each collect `2` liters;
- on day `7`, only Bob visits the spring, and he collects `6` liters;
- on day `8`, Alice and Bob visit the spring, and they each collect `3` liters;
- on day `9`, Bob and Carol visit the spring, and they each collect `3` liters;
- on day `10`, Alice and Bob visit the spring, and they each collect `3` liters.

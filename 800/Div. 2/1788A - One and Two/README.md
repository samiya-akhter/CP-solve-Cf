You are given a sequence `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. Each element of `a` is `1` or `2`.

Find out if an integer `k` exists so that the following conditions are met. 

 - `1 ≤ k ≤ n-1`, and
- `a_1 · a_2 · … · a_k = a_k+1 · a_k+2 · … · a_n`.

If there exist multiple `k` that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer `n` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`).

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2`).

## Output

For each test case, if there is no such `k`, print `-1`.

Otherwise, print the smallest possible `k`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
6
2 2 1 2 1 2
3
1 2 1
4
1 1 1 1
```

**Output:**

```
2
-1
1

```

## Note

For the first test case, `k=2` satisfies the condition since `a_1 · a_2 = a_3 · a_4 · a_5 · a_6 = 4`. `k=3` also satisfies the given condition, but the smallest should be printed.

For the second test case, there is no `k` that satisfies `a_1 · a_2 · … · a_k = a_k+1 · a_k+2 · … · a_n`

For the third test case, `k=1`, `2`, and `3` satisfy the given condition, so the answer is `1`.

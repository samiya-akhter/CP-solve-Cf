Given an array `a` of length `n`, which elements are equal to `-1` and `1`. Let's call the array `a` *good* if the following conditions are held at the same time:

 - `a_1 + a_2 + … + a_n ≥ 0`;
- `a_1 · a_2 · … · a_n = 1`.

In one operation, you can select an arbitrary element of the array `a_i` and change its value to the opposite. In other words, if `a_i = -1`, you can assign the value to `a_i := 1`, and if `a_i = 1`, then assign the value to `a_i := -1`.

Determine the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make the array `a` good. It can be shown that this is always possible.

## Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 500`) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) — the length of the array `a`.

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`a_i = ± 1`) — the elements of the array `a`.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations that need to be done to make the `a` array good.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
7
4
-1 -1 1 -1
5
-1 -1 -1 1 1
4
-1 1 -1 1
3
-1 -1 -1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
-1
2
-1 -1
```

**Output:**

```
1
1
0
3
0
1
2

```

## Note

In the first test case, we can assign the value `a_1 := 1`. Then `a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0 ≥ 0` and `a_1 · a_2 · a_3 · a_4 = 1 · (-1) · 1 · (-1) = 1`. Thus, we performed `1` operation.

In the second test case, we can assign `a_1 := 1`. Then `a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 ≥ 0` and `a_1 · a_2 · a_3 · a_4 · a_5 = 1 · (-1) · (-1) · 1 · 1 = 1`. Thus, we performed `1` operation.

In the third test case, `a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 = 0 ≥ 0` and `a_1 · a_2 · a_3 · a_4 = (-1) · 1 · (-1) · 1 = 1`. Thus, all conditions are already satisfied and no operations are needed.

In the fourth test case, we can assign the values `a_1 := 1, a_2 := 1, a_3 := 1`. Then `a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≥ 0` and `a_1 · a_2 · a_3 = 1 · 1 · 1 = 1`. Thus, we performed `3` operations.

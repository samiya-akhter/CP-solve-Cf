Call an array `a` of length `n` *sorted* if `a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ … ≤ a_n-1 ≤ a_n`.

Ntarsis has an array `a` of length `n`. 

He is allowed to perform one type of operation on it (zero or more times): 

 - Choose an index `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
- Add `1` to `a_1, a_2, …, a_i`.
- Subtract `1` from `a_i+1, a_i+2, …, a_n`.

The values of `a` can be negative after an operation.

Determine the minimum operations needed to make `a` **not sorted**.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 500`) — the length of the array `a`.

The next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`) — the values of array `a`.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `500`.

## Output

Output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array **not sorted**.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2
1 1
4
1 8 10 13
3
1 3 2
3
1 9 14
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
0
3

```

## Note

In the first case, we can perform `1` operation to make the array not sorted: 

 - Pick `i = 1`. The array `a` then becomes `[2, 0]`, which is not sorted.

In the second case, we can perform `2` operations to make the array not sorted: 

 - Pick `i = 3`. The array `a` then becomes `[2, 9, 11, 12]`.
- Pick `i = 3`. The array `a` then becomes `[3, 10, 12, 11]`, which is not sorted.

It can be proven that `1` and `2` operations are the minimal numbers of operations in the first and second test cases, respectively.

In the third case, the array is **already** not sorted, so we perform `0` operations.

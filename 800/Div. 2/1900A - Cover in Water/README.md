Filip has a row of cells, some of which are blocked, and some are empty. He wants all empty cells to have water in them. He has two actions at his disposal:

 - `1` — place water in an empty cell.
- `2` — remove water from a cell and place it in any other empty cell.

If at some moment cell `i` (`2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) is empty and both cells `i-1` and `i+1` contains water, then it becomes filled with water.

Find the minimum number of times he needs to perform action `1` in order to fill all empty cells with water. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the use of action `2`. Note that blocked cells neither contain water nor can Filip place water in them.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) — the number of cells. 

The next line contains a string `s` of length `n`. The `i`-th character of `s` is '`.`' if the cell `i` is empty and '`#`' if cell `i` is blocked.

## Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimal amount of actions `1` needed to fill all empty cells with water.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
3
...
7
##....#
7
..#.#..
4
####
10
#...#..#.#
```

**Output:**

```
2
2
5
0
2

```

## Note

**Test Case 1**

In the first test case, Filip can put water in cells `1` and `3`. As cell `2` is between `2` cells with water, it gets filled with water too.

**Test Case 2**

In the second case, he can put water sources in cells `3` and `5`. That results in cell `4` getting filled with water. Then he will remove water from cell `5` and place it into cell `6`. As cell `5`'s neighbors, cell `4` and cell `6`, have water in them, cell `5` also gets filled with water. You can see the illustration of this case below.

In the third case, he can put water in all the empty cells. That requires `5` actions of type `1`.

**Test Case 4**

In the fourth case, there are no empty cells. Therefore, he does not have to put any water in them.

**Test Case 5**

In the fifth test case, there exists a sequence of actions that requires only `2` type `1` actions.

You are given an integer `n`. You need to construct a permutation`^∗` `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` using integers from `1` to `n` such that the following condition is satisfied:

`a_1 mod a_2 ≥ a_2 mod a_3 ≥ … ≥ a_n-1 mod a_n,` where `u` mod `v` denotes the remainder of dividing `u` by `v`.

If multiple valid permutations exist, you may output any of them.

It can be shown that a valid permutation always exists for every `n ≥ 2`.

`^∗`A permutation of length `n` is an array consisting of `n` distinct integers from `1` to `n` in arbitrary order. For example, `[2,3,1,5,4]` is a permutation, but `[1,2,2]` is not a permutation (`2` appears twice in the array), and `[1,3,4]` is also not a permutation (`n=3` but there is `4` in the array).

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 100`).

## Output

For each test case, output on a single line `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, … a_n`.

If multiple valid permutations exist, you may output any of them.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2
3
4
5
```

**Output:**

```
2 1
2 3 1
2 4 3 1
3 5 4 2 1
```

## Note

In the second test case, `2 mod 3 ≥ 3 mod 1`, so the permutation `[2, 3, 1]` is valid.

In the third test case, `2 mod 4 ≥ 4 mod 3 ≥ 3 mod 1`, so the permutation `[2, 4, 3, 1]` is valid.

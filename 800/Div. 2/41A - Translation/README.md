The translation from the Berland language into the Birland language is not an easy task. Those languages are very similar: a Berlandish word differs from a Birlandish word with the same meaning a little: it is spelled (and pronounced) reversely. For example, a Berlandish word `code` corresponds to a Birlandish word `edoc`. However, making a mistake during the "translation" is easy. Vasya translated the word *s* from Berlandish into Birlandish as *t*. Help him: find out if he translated the word correctly.

## Input

The first line contains word *s*, the second line contains word *t*. The words consist of lowercase Latin letters. The input data do not contain unnecessary spaces. The words are not empty and their lengths do not exceed 100 symbols.

## Output

If the word *t* is a word *s*, written reversely, print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
code
edoc

```

**Output 1:**

```
YES

```

**Example 2:**

```
abb
aba

```

**Output 2:**

```
NO

```

**Example 3:**

```
code
code

```

**Output 3:**

```
NO

```

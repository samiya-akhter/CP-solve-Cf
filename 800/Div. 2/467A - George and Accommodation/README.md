George has recently entered the BSUCP (Berland State University for Cool Programmers). George has a friend Alex who has also entered the university. Now they are moving into a dormitory. 

George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has *n* rooms in total. At the moment the *i*-th room has *p*_(*i*) people living in it and the room can accommodate *q*_(*i*) people in total (*p*_(*i*) ≤ *q*_(*i*)). Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100) — the number of rooms.

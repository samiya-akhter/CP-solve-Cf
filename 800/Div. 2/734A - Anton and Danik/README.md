Anton likes to play chess, and so does his friend Danik.

Once they have played *n* games in a row. For each game it's known who was the winner — Anton or Danik. None of the games ended with a tie.

Now Anton wonders, who won more games, he or Danik? Help him determine this.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100 000) — the number of games played.

The second line contains a string *s*, consisting of *n* uppercase English letters '`A`' and '`D`' — the outcome of each of the games. The *i*-th character of the string is equal to '`A`' if the Anton won the *i*-th game and '`D`' if Danik won the *i*-th game.

## Output

If Anton won more games than Danik, print "`Anton`" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.

If Danik won more games than Anton, print "`Danik`" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.

If Anton and Danik won the same number of games, print "`Friendship`" (without quotes).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
6
ADAAAA

```

**Output 1:**

```
Anton

```

**Example 2:**

```

DDDAADA

```

**Output 2:**

```

**Example 3:**

```
6
DADADA

```

**Output 3:**

```

## Note

In the first sample, Anton won 6 games, while Danik — only 1. Hence, the answer is "`Anton`".

In the second sample, Anton won 3 games and Danik won 4 games, so the answer is "`Danik`".

In the third sample, both Anton and Danik won 3 games and the answer is "`Friendship`".

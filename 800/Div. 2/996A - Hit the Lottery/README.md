Allen has a LOT of money. He has `n` dollars in the bank. For security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not disclose the reasons here). The denominations for dollar bills are `1`, `5`, `10`, `20`, `100`. What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?

## Input

The first and only line of input contains a single integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`).

## Output

Output the minimum number of bills that Allen could receive.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
125

```

**Output 1:**

```
3

```

**Example 2:**

```
43

```

**Output 2:**

```
5

```

**Example 3:**

```
1000000000

```

**Output 3:**

```
10000000

```

## Note

In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a `100` dollar bill, a `20` dollar bill, and a `5` dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive `125` dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two `20` dollar bills and three `1` dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw `100000000` (ten million!) `100` dollar bills.

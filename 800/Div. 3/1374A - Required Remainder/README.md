You are given three integers `x, y` and `n`. Your task is to find the **maximum** integer `k` such that `0 ≤ k ≤ n` that `k mod x = y`, where `mod` is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator `%` to implement it.

In other words, with given `x, y` and `n` you need to find the maximum possible integer from `0` to `n` that has the remainder `y` modulo `x`.

You have to answer `t` independent test cases. It is guaranteed that such `k` exists for each test case.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4`) — the number of test cases. The next `t` lines contain test cases.

The only line of the test case contains three integers `x, y` and `n` (`2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9;~ 0 ≤ y < x;~ y ≤ n ≤ 10^9`).

It can be shown that such `k` always exists under the given constraints.

## Output

For each test case, print the answer — **maximum non-negative** integer `k` such that `0 ≤ k ≤ n` and `k mod x = y`. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
7
7 5 12345
5 0 4
10 5 15
17 8 54321
499999993 9 1000000000
10 5 187
2 0 999999999

```

**Output:**

```
12339
0
15
54306
999999995
185
999999998

```

## Note

In the first test case of the example, the answer is `12339 = 7 · 1762 + 5` (thus, `12339 mod 7 = 5`). It is obvious that there is no greater integer not exceeding `12345` which has the remainder `5` modulo `7`.

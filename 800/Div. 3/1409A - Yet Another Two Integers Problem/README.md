You are given two integers `a` and `b`.

In one move, you can choose some **integer** `k` from `1` to `10` and add it to `a` or subtract it from `a`. In other words, you choose an integer `k ∈ [1; 10]` and perform `a := a + k` or `a := a - k`. You may use **different** values of `k` in different moves.

Your task is to find the **minimum** number of moves required to obtain `b` from `a`.

You have to answer `t` independent test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`) — the number of test cases. Then `t` test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers `a` and `b` (`1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain `b` from `a`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
5 5
13 42
18 4
1337 420
123456789 1000000000
100500 9000

```

**Output:**

```
0
3
2
92
87654322
9150

```

## Note

In the first test case of the example, you don't need to do anything.

In the second test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: `13 arrow 23 arrow 32 arrow 42` (add `10`, add `9`, add `10`).

In the third test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: `18 arrow 10 arrow 4` (subtract `8`, subtract `6`).

A string is called *square* if it is some string written twice in a row. For example, the strings "`aa`", "`abcabc`", "`abab`" and "`baabaa`" are square. But the strings "`aaa`", "`abaaab`" and "`abcdabc`" are not square.

For a given string `s` determine if it is square.

## Input

The first line of input data contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) —the number of test cases.

This is followed by `t` lines, each containing a description of one test case. The given strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters and have lengths between `1` and `100` inclusive.

## Output

For each test case, output on a separate line:

 - `YES` if the string in the corresponding test case is square,
- `NO` otherwise.

You can output `YES` and `NO` in any case (for example, strings `yEs`, `yes`, `Yes` and `YES` will be recognized as a positive response).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
10
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
abab
abcabc
abacaba
xxyy
xyyx
xyxy

```

**Output:**

```
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
YES

```

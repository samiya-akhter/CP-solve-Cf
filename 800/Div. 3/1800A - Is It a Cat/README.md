You were walking down the street and heard a sound. The sound was described by the string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin characters. Now you want to find out if the sound was a cat meowing.

For the sound to be a meowing, the string can only contain the letters '`m`', '`e`', '`o`' and '`w`', in either uppercase or lowercase. Also: 

 - string must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '`m`' or '`M`'
- it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '`e`' or '`E`'
- it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '`o`' or '`O`'
- it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '`w`' or '`W`', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string end

For example, strings "`meow`", "`mmmEeOWww`", "`MeOooOw`" describe a meowing, but strings "`Mweo`", "`MeO`", "`moew`", "`MmEW`", "`meowmeow`" do not.

Determine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.

## Input

The first line of input data contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 50`) — the length of the string describing the sound.

The second line of each test case contains a string `s` of `n` characters. The string describes the sound you heard and consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

## Output

For each test case, output on a separate line: 

 - `YES` if the sound was a cat meowing;
- `NO` otherwise.

You can output `YES` and `NO` in any case (for example, strings `yEs`, `yes`, `Yes` and `YES` will be recognized as positive response).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
7
4
meOw
14
mMmeoOoWWWwwwW
3
mew
7
MmeEeUw
4
MEOW
6
MmyaVW
5
meowA
```

**Output:**

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
NO

```

## Note

In the first test case, the string consists of a sequence of characters '`m`', '`e`', '`O`', '`w`', which satisfies the definition of meowing.

In the second test case, the string consists of a sequence of `3` characters '`m`' and '`M`', one '`e`', a sequence of `3` characters '`o`' and '`O`' and a sequence of `7` characters '`w`' and '`W`', which satisfies the definition of meowing.

In the third test case, the string does not describe a meowing because it lacks a sequence of '`o`' or '`O`' characters between '`e`' and '`w`'.

In the fourth test case, the string contains the character '`U`', so it does not describe a meowing.

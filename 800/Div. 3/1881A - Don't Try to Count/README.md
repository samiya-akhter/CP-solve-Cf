Given a string `x` of length `n` and a string `s` of length `m` (`n · m ≤ 25`), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, you can apply any number of operations to the string `x`.

In one operation, you append the current value of `x` to the end of the string `x`. Note that the value of `x` will change after this.

For example, if `x =`"`aba`", then after applying operations, `x` will change as follows: "`aba`" `arrow` "`abaaba`" `arrow` "`abaabaabaaba`".

After what **minimum** number of operations `s` will appear in `x` as a substring? A substring of a string is defined as a **contiguous** segment of it.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two numbers `n` and `m` (`1 ≤ n · m ≤ 25`) — the lengths of strings `x` and `s`, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string `x` of length `n`.

The third line of each test case contains the string `s` of length `m`.

## Output

For each test case, output a single number — the **minimum** number of operations after which `s` will appear in `x` as a substring. If this is not possible, output `-1`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
12
1 5
a
aaaaa
5 5
eforc
force
2 5
ab
ababa
3 5
aba
ababa
4 3
babb
bbb
5 1
aaaaa
a
4 2
aabb
ba
2 8
bk
kbkbkbkb
12 2
fjdgmujlcont
tf
2 2
aa
aa
3 5
abb
babba
1 19
m
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
```

**Output:**

```
3
1
2
-1
1
0
1
3
1
0
2
5

```

## Note

In the first test case of the example, after `2` operations, the string will become "`aaaa`", and after `3` operations, it will become "`aaaaaaaa`", so the answer is `3`.

In the second test case of the example, after applying `1` operation, the string will become "`ecolorredforceforc`", where the substring is highlighted in red.

In the fourth test case of the example, it can be shown that it is impossible to obtain the desired string as a substring.

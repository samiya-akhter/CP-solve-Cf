Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer `n`. On their turn, the player can add `1` to the current integer or subtract `1`. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If **after** Vanya's move the integer is divisible by `3`, then he wins. If `10` moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.

Write a program that, based on the integer `n`, determines who will win if both players play optimally.

## Input

The first line contains the integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of test cases.

The single line of each test case contains the integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`).

## Output

For each test case, print "`First`" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "`Second`" without quotes if Vova wins.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
1
3
5
100
999
1000
```

**Output:**

```
First
Second
First
First
Second
First

```

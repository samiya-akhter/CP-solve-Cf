*There is a little bit of the outlaw in everyone, and a little bit of the hero too.**The heroic outlaw Robin Hood is famous for taking from the rich and giving to the poor.*

Robin encounters `n` people starting from the `1`-st and ending with the `n`-th. The `i`-th person has `a_i` gold. If `a_i ≥ k`, Robin will take all `a_i` gold, and if `a_i=0`, Robin will give `1` gold if he has any. Robin starts with `0` gold.

Find out how many people Robin gives gold to.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (`1≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers `n`, `k` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100`) — the number of people and the threshold at which Robin Hood takes the gold.

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`0 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`) — the gold of each person.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the number of people that will get gold from Robin Hood.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2 2
2 0
3 2
3 0 0
6 2
0 3 0 0 0 0
2 5
5 4
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
0

```

## Note

In the first test case, Robin takes `2` gold from the first person and gives a gold to the second person.

In the second test case, Robin takes `3` gold and gives `1` gold to each of the next `2` people.

In the third test case, Robin takes `3` gold and so only gives gold to `3` other people.

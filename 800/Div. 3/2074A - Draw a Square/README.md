The pink soldiers have given you `4` **distinct points** on the plane. The `4` points' coordinates are `(-l,0)`, `(r,0)`, `(0,-d)`, `(0,u)` correspondingly, where `l`, `r`, `d`, `u` are positive integers.

 ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/280d7475bd2765cb5054e65e90e80526f8b96081.png)   In the diagram, a square is drawn by connecting the four points `L`, `R`, `D`, `U`. Please determine if it is possible to draw a square`^∗` with the given points as its vertices.

`^∗`A *square* is defined as a polygon consisting of `4` vertices, of which all sides have equal length and all inner angles are equal. No two edges of the polygon may intersect each other.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains four integers `l`, `r`, `d`, `u` (`1 ≤ l,r,d,u ≤ 10`).

## Output

For each test case, if you can draw a square using the four points, output "`Yes`". Otherwise, output "`No`".

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", and "`YES`" will also be recognized as positive responses.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
2
2 2 2 2
1 2 3 4
```

**Output:**

```
Yes
No

```

## Note

On the first test case, the four given points form a square, so the answer is "`Yes`".

On the second test case, the four given points do not form a square, so the answer is "`No`".

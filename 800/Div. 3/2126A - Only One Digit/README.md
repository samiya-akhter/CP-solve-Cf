You are given an integer `x`. You need to find the smallest non-negative integer `y` such that the numbers `x` and `y` share at least one common digit. In other words, there must exist a decimal digit `d` that appears in both the representation of the number `x` and the number `y`.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer `x` (`1 ≤ x ≤ 1000`).

## Output

For each test case, output one integer `y` — the minimum non-negative number that satisfies the condition.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
6
96
78
122
696
```

**Output:**

```
6
6
7
1
6

```

## Note

In the first test case, the numbers `6` and `6` share the common digit '`6`'. Moreover, there is no natural number smaller than this that shares a common digit.

In the second test case, the numbers `6` and `96` share the common digit '`6`'.

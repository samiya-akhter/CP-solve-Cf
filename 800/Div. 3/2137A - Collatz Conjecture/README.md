You are doing a research paper on the famous Collatz Conjecture. In your experiment, you start off with an integer `x`, and you do the following procedure `k` times: 

 - If `x` is even, divide `x` by `2`.
- Otherwise, set `x` to `3· x+1`.

For example, starting off with `21` and doing the procedure `5` times, you get `21arrow64arrow32arrow16arrow8arrow4`.

After all `k` iterations, you are left with the final value of `x`. Unfortunately, you forgot the initial value. Please output any possible initial value of `x`.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 400`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains two integers `k` and `x` (`1 ≤ k,x ≤ 20`).

## Output

For each test case, print any possible initial value on a new line. It can be shown that the answer always exists.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
1 4
1 5
5 4
```

**Output:**

```
1
10
21

```

## Note

In the first test case, since `1` is odd, performing the procedure `k=1` times results in `1·3+1=4`, so `1` is a valid output.

In the second test case, since `10` is even, performing the procedure `k=1` times results in `10/2=5`, so `10` is a valid output.

The third test case is explained in the statement.

You are given an array `a` of length `n`.

Your task is to find the maximum possible average value of any subarray`^∗` of the array `a`.

Formally, for any indices `l, r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, define the average of the subarray `a_l, a_l+1, …, a_r` as the sum of elements divided by the number of elements or: `avg(l,r) = 1/r-l+1 Σ_i=l^r a_i` Output the maximum value of `avg(l,r)` over all choices of `l, r`.

`^∗`An array `b` is a subarray of an array `a` if `b` can be obtained from `a` by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10`) — the length of the array `a`.

The second line of each testcase contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10`) — the elements of the array.

## Output

For each testcase, output a single integer — the maximum average of any subarray of the given array.

It can be shown that the answer is always an integer.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
4
3 3 3 3
5
7 1 6 9 9
5
3 4 4 4 3
```

**Output:**

```
3
9
4
```

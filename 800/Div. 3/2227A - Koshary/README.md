Yousef is at the coordinates `(0, 0)` and wants to reach a plate of Koshary at `(x, y)`.

To get there, Yousef takes long steps. From any point `(a, b)`, a long step moves him to: 

 - `(a + 2, b)` or `(a, b + 2)`

However, Yousef is allowed to take **at most one** short step during his entire journey. A short step moves him to: 

 - `(a + 1, b)` or `(a, b + 1)`

Can Yousef reach the exact coordinates `(x, y)` of the Koshary plate?

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers `x` and `y` (`1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10`) — the coordinates of the Koshary plate.

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" if Yousef can reach the Koshary plate and "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will be recognized as positive responses.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
1 1
1 2
4 6
5 9
7 2
10 10
```

**Output:**

```
NO
YES
YES
NO
YES
YES
```

## Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to reach `(1, 1)` using the mentioned steps.

In the second test case, an optimal sequence of steps would be: `(0, 0) xrightarrowlong (0, 2) xrightarrowshort (1, 2)`

In the third test case, an optimal sequence of steps would be: `(0, 0) xrightarrowlong (0, 2) xrightarrowlong (2, 2) xrightarrowlong (2, 4) xrightarrowlong (4, 4) xrightarrowlong (4, 6)`

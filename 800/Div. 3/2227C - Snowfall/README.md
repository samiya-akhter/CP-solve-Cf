Yousef has given you an array `a` of `n` positive integers.

Let `f(a)` denote the number of subarrays`^∗` of `a` whose **product** is divisible by `6`.

More formally, for every pair of indices `l` and `r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, consider the subarray `a_l, a_l+1, …, a_r`. This subarray is counted if the product of its elements is divisible by `6`.

For example, if `a = [1, 6, 2]`, then the subarrays whose products are divisible by `6` are `[6]`, `[1, 6]`, `[6, 2]`, and `[1, 6, 2]`, so `f(a) = 4`.

Your task is to reorder the elements of the array `a` so that `f(a)` is minimized. If there are multiple ways to do this, you may output any of them.

`^∗`An array `b` is a subarray of an array `a` if `b` can be obtained from `a` by deleting several (possibly zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) elements from the end.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`) — the size of the array.

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

## Output

For each test case, output the array after reordering it in such a way that `f(a)` is minimized. If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
6
12 7 9 4 18 5
4
3 6 2 8
7
1 10 15 20 3 6 9
5
11 14 21 2 5
3
6 6 6
```

**Output:**

```
12 18 4 7 5 9
2 8 3 6
6 10 20 1 15 3 9
21 5 11 2 14
6 6 6
```

## Note

In the first test case, an optimal arrangement is `a = [12, 18, 4, 7, 5, 9]`. The subarrays whose products are divisible by `6` are: 

 - `[12]`
- `[18]`
- `[12, 18]`
- `[18, 4]`
- `[12, 18, 4]`
- `[18, 4, 7]`
- `[12, 18, 4, 7]`
- `[18, 4, 7, 5]`
- `[4, 7, 5, 9]`
- `[12, 18, 4, 7, 5]`
- `[18, 4, 7, 5, 9]`
- `[12, 18, 4, 7, 5, 9]`

Therefore, `f(a) = 12`. It can be proven that no other arrangement yields a smaller value of `f(a)`.

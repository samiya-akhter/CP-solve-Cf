Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:

 - if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;
- if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).

You are given an integer number `n`. Tanya will subtract one from it `k` times. Your task is to print the result after all `k` subtractions.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integer numbers `n` and `k` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ k ≤ 50`) — the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.

## Output

Print one integer number — the result of the decreasing `n` by one `k` times.

It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
512 4

```

**Output 1:**

```
50

```

**Example 2:**

```
1000000000 9

```

**Output 2:**

```
1

```

## Note

The first example corresponds to the following sequence: `512 arrow 511 arrow 510 arrow 51 arrow 50`.

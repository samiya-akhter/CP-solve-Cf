A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called *round* if it is of the form `d00...0`. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from `1` to `9` (inclusive) are round.

For example, the following numbers are round: `4000`, `1`, `9`, `800`, `90`. The following numbers are **not** round: `110`, `707`, `222`, `1001`.

You are given a positive integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4`). Represent the number `n` as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number `n` as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases in the input. Then `t` test cases follow.

Each test case is a line containing an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4`).

## Output

Print `t` answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer `k` — the minimum number of summands. Next, `k` terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is `n`. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
5009
7
9876
10000
10

```

**Output:**

```
2
5000 9
1
7 
4
800 70 6 9000 
1
10000 
1
10 

```

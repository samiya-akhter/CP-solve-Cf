You are given four **distinct** integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. 

Timur and three other people are running a marathon. The value `a` is the distance that Timur has run and `b`, `c`, `d` correspond to the distances the other three participants ran. 

Output the number of participants in front of Timur.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The description of each test case consists of four **distinct** integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` (`0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 10^4`).

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of participants in front of Timur.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2 3 4 1
10000 0 1 2
500 600 400 300
0 9999 10000 9998
```

**Output:**

```
2
0
1
3

```

## Note

For the first test case, there are `2` people in front of Timur, specifically the participants who ran distances of `3` and `4`. The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.

For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of `10000` while all others ran a distance of `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively.

For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of `600` while Timur ran a distance of `500`.

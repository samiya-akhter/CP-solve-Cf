There is a string `s` of length `3`, consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. Check if it is equal to "`YES`" (without quotes), where each letter can be in any case. For example, "`yES`", "`Yes`", "`yes`" are all allowable.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`) — the number of testcases.

The description of each test consists of one line containing one string `s` consisting of three characters. Each character of `s` is either an uppercase or lowercase English letter.

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" (without quotes) if `s` satisfies the condition, and "`NO`" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "`YES`" and "`NO`" in any case (for example, strings "`yES`", "`yes`" and "`Yes`" will be recognized as a positive response).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
10
YES
yES
yes
Yes
YeS
Noo
orZ
yEz
Yas
XES
```

**Output:**

```
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO

```

## Note

The first five test cases contain the strings "`YES`", "`yES`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", "`YeS`". All of these are equal to "`YES`", where each character is either uppercase or lowercase.

Suneet has three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to `10`.

Output "`YES`" if there is such a pair, and "`NO`" otherwise.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (`0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9`).

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" if such a pair exists, and "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`" and "`YES`" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
8 1 2
4 4 5
9 9 9
0 0 0
8 5 3
```

**Output:**

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

```

## Note

For the first test case, by choosing the digits `8` and `2` we can obtain a sum of `8 + 2 = 10` which satisfies the condition, thus the output should be "`YES`".

For the second test case, any combination of chosen digits won't be at least `10`, thus the output should be "`NO`" (note that we can not choose the digit on the same position twice).

For the third test case, any combination of chosen digits will have a sum equal to `18`, thus the output should be "`YES`".

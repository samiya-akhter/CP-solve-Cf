There are three cards with letters `a`, `b`, `c` placed in a row in some order. You can do the following operation **at most once**: 

 - Pick two cards, and swap them.

 Is it possible that the row becomes `abc` after the operation? Output "`YES`" if it is possible, and "`NO`" otherwise.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 6`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of each of the three characters `a`, `b`, and `c` exactly once, representing the cards.

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" if you can make the row `abc` with at most one operation, or "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`" and "`YES`" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
```

**Output:**

```
YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

## Note

In the first test case, we don't need to do any operations, since the row is already `abc`.

In the second test case, we can swap `c` and `b`: `acb → abc`.

In the third test case, we can swap `b` and `a`: `bac → abc`.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to make `abc` using **at most one** operation.

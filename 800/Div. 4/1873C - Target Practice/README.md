A `10 × 10` target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.

 ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/440826fc807f4a298e765d2288c50226f4ffa740.png) Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.

## Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either `X` (representing an arrow) or `.` (representing no arrow).

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of points of the arrows.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
X.........
..........
.......X..
.....X....
......X...
..........
.........X
..X.......

```

**Output:**

```
17
0
5
220

```

## Note

In the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is `3 × 1 + 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 17`. 

In the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is `0`.

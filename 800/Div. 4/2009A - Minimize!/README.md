You are given two integers `a` and `b` (`a ≤ b`). Over all possible integer values of `c` (`a ≤ c ≤ b`), find the minimum value of `(c - a) + (b - c)`.

## Input

The first line contains `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 55`) — the number of test cases. 

Each test case contains two integers `a` and `b` (`1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`).

## Output

For each test case, output the minimum possible value of `(c - a) + (b - c)` on a new line.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
1 2
3 10
5 5
```

**Output:**

```
1
7
0

```

## Note

In the first test case, you can choose `c = 1` and obtain an answer of `(1 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 1`. It can be shown this is the minimum value possible.

In the second test case, you can choose `c = 6` and obtain an answer of `(6 - 3) + (10 - 6) = 7`. It can be shown this is the minimum value possible.

A string consisting of only characters 'p', 'q', and 'w' is painted on a glass window of a store. Ship walks past the store, standing directly in front of the glass window, and observes string `a`. Ship then heads inside the store, looks directly at the same glass window, and observes string `b`.

Ship gives you string `a`. Your job is to find and output `b`.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string `a` (`1 ≤ |a| ≤ 100`) — the string Ship observes from outside the store. It is guaranteed that `a` only contains characters 'p', 'q', and 'w'.

## Output

For each test case, output string `b`, the string Ship observes from inside the store, on a new line.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
qwq
ppppp
pppwwwqqq
wqpqwpqwwqp
pqpqpqpq
```

**Output:**

```
pwp
qqqqq
pppwwwqqq
qpwwpqwpqpw
pqpqpqpq

```

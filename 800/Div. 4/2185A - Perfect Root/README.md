A positive integer `x` is a perfect root if there exists an integer `y` such that `√(y) = x`. For example, `5` is a perfect root because `√(25) = 5`.

For each test case, output `n` distinct perfect roots. Note that the values only need to be distinct within each test case; you can use the same value in different test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 20`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 20`) — the number of perfect roots to output.

## Output

For each test case, output `n` distinct perfect roots. Each perfect root `x` must be in the range `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
1
2
5

```

**Output:**

```
1
2 4
2 102 43 1 21
```

## Note

For the first test case: 

 - `1` is a perfect root because `√(1) = 1`.

For the second test case: 

 - `2` is a perfect root because `√(4) = 2`.
- `4` is a perfect root because `√(16) = 4`.

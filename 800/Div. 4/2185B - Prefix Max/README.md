You are given an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. 

The value of an array is the sum of the maximums of each prefix of the array. More formally, the value of an array `a` is `Σ_i=1 ^n max(a_1, …, a_i)`. For example, the value of the array [`1, 2, 1`] is `max(1) + max(1, 2) + max(1, 2, 1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5`.

You can choose two indices `i` and `j` and swap elements `a_i` and `a_j`; this operation can be applied **at most** one time.

Find the maximum possible value of the array `a` after at most one operation.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 50`) — the length of the array `a`.

The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4`) — the array `a`.

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the array `a` after the swap has been performed.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
5
2 1 4 5 3
2
5 1
3
3 2 1
2
6 7
```

**Output:**

```
25
10
9
14
```

## Note

For the first test case, we can swap `a_1` with `a_4` to get the array [`5, 1, 4, 2, 3`], which has a value of `max(5) + max(5, 1) + max(5, 1, 4) + max(5, 1, 4, 2) + max(5, 1, 4, 2, 3) = 25`.

For the second test case, the current value of the array is `max(5) + max(5, 1) = 10`. If we were to swap `a_1` and `a_2`, `a` would be equal to [`1, 5`], which has a value of `max(1) + max(1, 5) = 6`, meaning the best option is to not perform a swap.

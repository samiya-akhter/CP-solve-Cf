"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the *k*-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of *n* participants took part in the contest (*n* ≥ *k*), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (1 ≤ *k* ≤ *n* ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*_(1), *a*_(2), ..., *a*_(*n*) (0 ≤ *a*_(*i*) ≤ 100), where *a*_(*i*) is the score earned by the participant who got the *i*-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all *i* from 1 to *n* - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: *a*_(*i*) ≥ *a*_(*i* + 1)).

## Output

Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
8 5
10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5

```

**Output 1:**

```
6

```

**Example 2:**

```
4 2
0 0 0 0

```

**Output 2:**

```
0

```

## Note

In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.

In the second example nobody got a positive score.

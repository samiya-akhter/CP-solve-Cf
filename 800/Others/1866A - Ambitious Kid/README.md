Chaneka, Pak Chanek's child, is an ambitious kid, so Pak Chanek gives her the following problem to test her ambition.

Given an array of integers `[A_1, A_2, A_3, …, A_N]`. In one operation, Chaneka can choose one element, then increase or decrease the element's value by `1`. Chaneka can do that operation multiple times, even for different elements.

What is the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that `A_1 × A_2 × A_3 × … × A_N = 0`?

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `N` (`1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`).

The second line contains `N` integers `A_1, A_2, A_3, …, A_N` (`-10^5 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^5`).

## Output

An integer representing the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that `A_1 × A_2 × A_3 × … × A_N = 0`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
3
2 -6 5

```

**Output 1:**

```
2

```

**Example 2:**

```
1
-3

```

**Output 2:**

```
3

```

**Example 3:**

```
5
0 -1 0 1 0

```

**Output 3:**

```
0

```

## Note

In the first example, initially, `A_1× A_2× A_3=2×(-6)×5=-60`. Chaneka can do the following sequence of operations:

 - Decrease the value of `A_1` by `1`. Then, `A_1× A_2× A_3=1×(-6)×5=-30`
- Decrease the value of `A_1` by `1`. Then, `A_1× A_2× A_3=0×(-6)×5=0`

In the third example, Chaneka does not have to do any operations, because from the start, it already holds that `A_1× A_2× A_3× A_4× A_5=0×(-1)×0×1×0=0`

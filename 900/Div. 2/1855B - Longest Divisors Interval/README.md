Given a positive integer `n`, find the maximum size of an interval `[l, r]` of positive integers such that, for every `i` in the interval (i.e., `l ≤ i ≤ r`), `n` is a multiple of `i`.

Given two integers `l≤ r`, the size of the interval `[l, r]` is `r-l+1` (i.e., it coincides with the number of integers belonging to the interval).

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of the description of each test case contains one integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`).

## Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the maximum size of a valid interval.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
10
1
40
990990
4204474560
169958913706572972
365988220345828080
387701719537826430
620196883578129853
864802341280805662
1000000000000000000
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
6
4
22
3
1
2
2

```

## Note

In the first test case, a valid interval with maximum size is `[1, 1]` (it's valid because `n = 1` is a multiple of `1`) and its size is `1`.

In the second test case, a valid interval with maximum size is `[4, 5]` (it's valid because `n = 40` is a multiple of `4` and `5`) and its size is `2`.

In the third test case, a valid interval with maximum size is `[9, 11]`.

In the fourth test case, a valid interval with maximum size is `[8, 13]`.

In the seventh test case, a valid interval with maximum size is `[327869, 327871]`.

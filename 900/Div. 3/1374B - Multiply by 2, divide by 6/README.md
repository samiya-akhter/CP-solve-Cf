You are given an integer `n`. In one move, you can either multiply `n` by two or divide `n` by `6` (if it is divisible by `6` without the remainder).

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain `1` from `n` or determine if it's impossible to do that.

You have to answer `t` independent test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`) — the number of test cases. Then `t` test cases follow. 

The only line of the test case contains one integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to obtain `1` from `n` if it's possible to do that or `-1` if it's impossible to obtain `1` from `n`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
7
1
2
3
12
12345
15116544
387420489

```

**Output:**

```
0
-1
2
-1
-1
12
36

```

## Note

Consider the sixth test case of the example. The answer can be obtained by the following sequence of moves from the given integer `15116544`:

 - Divide by `6` and get `2519424`;
- divide by `6` and get `419904`;
- divide by `6` and get `69984`;
- divide by `6` and get `11664`;
- multiply by `2` and get `23328`;
- divide by `6` and get `3888`;
- divide by `6` and get `648`;
- divide by `6` and get `108`;
- multiply by `2` and get `216`;
- divide by `6` and get `36`;
- divide by `6` and get `6`;
- divide by `6` and get `1`.

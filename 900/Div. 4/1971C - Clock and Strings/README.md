There is a clock labeled with the numbers `1` through `12` in clockwise order, as shown below.

 ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/b8b6b4e6d43054edcd3b74127930ce9d45284500.png)In this example, `(a,b,c,d)=(2,9,10,6)`, and the strings intersect. 

Alice and Bob have four **distinct** integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` not more than `12`. Alice ties a red string connecting `a` and `b`, and Bob ties a blue string connecting `c` and `d`. Do the strings intersect? (The strings are straight line segments.)

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 5940`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains four **distinct** integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` (`1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 12`).

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" (without quotes) if the strings intersect, and "`NO`" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "`YES`" and "`NO`" in any case (for example, strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", and "`Yes`" will be recognized as a positive response).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
15
2 9 10 6
3 8 9 1
1 2 3 4
5 3 4 12
1 8 2 10
3 12 11 8
9 10 12 1
12 1 10 2
3 12 6 9
1 9 8 4
6 7 9 12
7 12 9 6
10 12 11 1
3 9 6 12
1 4 3 5
```

**Output:**

```
YES
NO
NO
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
YES
YES
YES
YES

```

## Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement.

In the second test case, the strings do not intersect, as shown below.

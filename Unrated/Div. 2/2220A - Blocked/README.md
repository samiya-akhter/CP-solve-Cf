Given an array `a` of integers of size `n`, we say that a position `1 ≤ i ≤ n` is *blocked* if `a_i` can be expressed as the sum of a subset of `a_1, a_2, …, a_i-1` (i.e. there exist `1 ≤ j_1 < j_2 < … < j_k ≤ i-1` such that `a_j_1 + a_j_2 + … + a_j_k = a_i`). Reorder `a` so that no position is blocked or report that it is impossible.

For example, reordering the array [`3, 2, 5`] to [`2, 3, 5`] makes position `3` blocked, since we can express `5 = 2 + 3`, but if we reorder it to [`3, 5, 2`], no position is blocked.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 400`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 200`).

The second line contains `n` integers, denoting the array `a` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`).

## Output

For each test case, print any order of `a` such that no position is blocked if it exists, otherwise print `-1`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
3
1 5 9
4
1 3 3 2
3
1 2 3
1
1

```

**Output:**

```
5 9 1
-1
3 1 2
1
```

## Note

In the third test case, the array [`3, 1, 2`] has no position blocked:

Position `1` is not blocked since `3` can't be expressed as the sum of a subset of [].

Position `2` is not blocked since `1` can't be expressed as the sum of a subset of [`3`].

Position `3` is not blocked since `2` can't be expressed as the sum of a subset of [`3, 1`].

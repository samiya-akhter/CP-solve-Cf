You are given two integers `x` and `y` such that `y > x` and `y mod x = 0` (that is, `y` is divisible by `x`).

Your task is to determine whether there exists an integer `z` such that

 - `z` lies between `x` and `y` (that is, `x < z < y`);
- `z` is divisible by `x` (that is, `z mod x = 0`);
- `y` is not divisible by `z` (that is, `y mod z ≠ 0`).

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). The description of the test cases follows. 

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers `x` and `y` (`1 ≤ x < y ≤ 10^18`; `y mod x = 0`).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows: if the required number `z` exists, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`. You may print each letter in any case.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
1 2
1 3
1234567890 12345678900
2 8
7 84
```

**Output:**

```
NO
YES
YES
YES
YES
```

## Note

In the second test case of the example, you can use `z = 2`.

In the third test case of the example, you can use `z = 7407407340`.

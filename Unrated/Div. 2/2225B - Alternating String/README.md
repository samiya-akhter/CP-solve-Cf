Let us call a string `t` *alternating* if for every `i` from `1` to `n - 1`, the condition `t_i ≠ t_i + 1` holds.

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the letters "`a`" and/or "`b`". You may perform the following operation on it **at most once**:

 - choose a substring `s_ls_l+1… s_r` consisting of at least one character;
- after choosing the substring, you may invert all letters in it, that is, change every "`a`" to "`b`" and every "`b`" to "`a`" (you are allowed to do it, but you don't have to do it);
- reverse the chosen substring, that is, transform the string `s_1s_2… s_l-1s_ls_l+1… s_rs_r+1… s_n` into `s_1s_2… s_l-1s_rs_r-1… s_ls_r+1… s_n`.

Note that when performing such an operation, you are not required to do the second step. For example, for the string `s =~`"`ababbab`", after one operation you can obtain "`abababa`" by choosing the substring `s_5s_6s_7` and doing the second step, or "`bababab`" by choosing the substring `s_1s_2s_3s_4` and not doing the second step. However, you always have to perform the third step of the operation. 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to obtain any *alternating* string from the string `s`.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). The description of the test cases follows. 

Each test case consists of one line containing one string `s` (`2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5`). The string consists only of lowercase Latin letters "`a`" and/or "`b`".

Additional constraints on the input: 

 - the sum of string lengths over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

## Output

For each test case, output one of the following:

 - `YES`, if it is possible to obtain an *alternating* string from `s`;
- `NO` otherwise.

You may output each letter in any case.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
8
abbaba
aaaaa
bababba
ab
abbaabba
bbb
ababa
aabb
```

**Output:**

```
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO
YES
YES
YES
```

## Note

In the first example, you can choose the substring `s_3 s_4 s_5 s_6` and skip the second step; then you get the string "`ababab`".

In the third example, you can choose the substring `s_1 s_2 s_3 s_4 s_5` and perform the second step; then you get the string "`abababa`".

In the fourth example, the string is already alternating.

In the sixth example, you can choose the substring `s_2` and perform the second step; then you get the string "`bab`".

You are given an integer `n`. You need to construct an array of integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 · n` for all `i` from `1` to `n`.
- All elements of the array and the sums of adjacent elements are pairwise distinct. In other words, among the numbers `{a_1, a_2, …, a_n, a_1 + a_2, a_2 + a_3, …, a_n - 1 + a_n}`, there should not be two equal numbers.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The only line of each test case contains one integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 500`).

## Output

For each test case, output an array of length `n` that satisfies the condition of the problem. It can be shown that such an array always exists under the given constraints.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
1
3
6
```

**Output:**

```
1 
6 2 3
8 1 11 2 3 4
```

## Note

In the second example, all elements and adjacent sums form the set `6, 2, 3, 8, 5`, all of whose elements are distinct.

In the third example, all elements and adjacent sums form the set `8, 1, 11, 2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 5, 7`, whose elements are also distinct.
